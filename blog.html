        <p>So far, I've learned about html, CSS, and processing. A couple of weeks ago, I created<br>
           a <a href="https://besvi.github.io/ICS3U-Hardware/SpecDev.html">website</a>
          on specialty input devices. I also used Processing to create two sketches, recreating assignments set by Mr. O.
          
        <h2>Things I learnt</h2>
  Among the things I learnt during this project, some of the most important in my mind are how to create a webpage with html<br>
  and make it look good/somewhat acceptable aesthetically, or more accurately, how to simply alter the look of my webpage through<br>
  the use of CSS. Other things I learnt were the importance of saving your work to the appropriate destination, as well as how<br>
  coding is quite difficult, though not as difficult as I originially expected it to be-- which was rocket science level.

        <h2>Things I still want to learn</h2>
    I want to learn how to do more with CSS to improve the look of a webpage, specifically being effects and design elements.<br>
    I also want to learn about how to use variables in my code for a more interactive platform 
        </p>

        <p> Today I managed to complete exercise 3, where circles had to be made with the movement of the cursor. The colour
            scheme had to be in shades of blue, which actually ended up being a lot less complicated than it looked. Upon finishing
            that, I tried to figure out exercise 4, which involved two independently moving forms growing in size and changing in
            in colour with a max set smaller than the window dimensions. As of now, I have still not been able to complete it.

       <h2> eternal suffering</h2>

        <p>I still have not been able to complete the exercise, but I have been able to utilize variables to get closer to the desired
        end product. The flashing colours hurt me and I am suffering. Thanks
    </p>

    <p>I forgot to do this blog thing, but on the bright side, I managed to complete the exercises. They're not perfect, but I'm 
        satisfied enough with the result. I was able to learn about loops, variables, conditional statements, and colour values.
