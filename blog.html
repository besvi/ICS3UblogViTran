        <h2>First post</h2>
        <h6>Posted Monday March 19, 2018</h6>
        
        <p>So far, I've learned about html, CSS, and processing. A couple of weeks ago, I created<br>
           a <a href="https://besvi.github.io/ICS3U-Hardware/SpecDev.html">website</a>
          on specialty input devices. I also used Processing to create two sketches, recreating assignments set by Mr. O.
          
        <h2>Things I learnt</h2>
  Among the things I learnt during this project, some of the most important in my mind are how to create a webpage with html<br>
  and make it look good/somewhat acceptable aesthetically, or more accurately, how to simply alter the look of my webpage through<br>
  the use of CSS. Other things I learnt were the importance of saving your work to the appropriate destination, as well as how<br>
  coding is quite difficult, though not as difficult as I originially expected it to be-- which was rocket science level.

        <h2>Things I still want to learn</h2>
    I want to learn how to do more with CSS to improve the look of a webpage, specifically being effects and design elements.<br>
    I also want to learn about how to use variables in my code for a more interactive platform
